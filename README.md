### Hello, friend...

I'm just a passionate **web developer** and **tech enthusiast** who loves to code and play around with green terminals üßë‚Äçüíª
(I use arch btw)

```
E: Who are you?
V: Who? "Who" is but the form following the function of "what" and what I am is a man in a mask.
E: Well I can see that.
V: Of course you can. I'm not questioning your powers of observation, I'm merely remarking upon the paradox of asking a masked man who he is.
